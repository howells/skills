# WireText Guidance

WireText is for low-fidelity wireframes and structural UI exploration.

Use it when:

- a user asks for wireframes
- a feature needs layout exploration before implementation
- you want to compare multiple structural directions quickly

Do not use it for:

- rendered-page verification
- responsive QA
- pixel-perfect design review
- replacing Figma when a real design file exists

## Priority

For UI workflows, prefer:

1. WireText MCP for wireframes, if available
2. ASCII wireframes in docs when WireText is unavailable
3. browser screenshots later for rendered verification
4. Figma MCP when an actual design file exists

## Expected Outputs

When using WireText, preserve enough context for downstream work:

- editable WireText URL, if the server returns one
- exported text wireframe, if available
- a short note in the design/spec doc explaining what the wireframe covers

If the workflow creates assets, store exported artifacts under:

- `docs/design/specs/assets/YYYY-MM-DD-topic/`

and reference them from the design doc.

## Hand-off Rule

WireText defines structure:

- page sections
- block hierarchy
- key interaction points
- rough layout relationships

It does not define visual fidelity. After wireframing:

- use design docs and interface rules for aesthetic direction
- use browser screenshots for rendered-page review
- use Figma MCP if an exact design source exists
